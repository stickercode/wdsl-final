      <p>
        I've traveled Japan for the first time and it did not disappoint me. Ever since i was kid, i wanted to go to Japan to see the whole culture: the festivals, the bustling streets of Tokyo (the famous crossing), its glorious catalogs of Anime, Manga, Collections...and Music (as a music lover and collector, there are some places that are truly worth looking), and boi oh boi, it was so glorious i couldn't contain my tears. It was the best traveling experience I've ever have. This is my entry (or guide) of my experience in Japan.  
        <strong>Do note, while the experience is so fun, let us not glorify Japan and other countries, like any other countries out there, Japan is no exception to problems. And also, when traveling to Japan (or in general), please be respectful, lets not be one of those tourists.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of these places were traveled by train and bus...and <strong>alot</strong> of walking. Wear something that is comfortable and won't hurt your feet while walking and standing. Before I start, let's talk about the train system, it is was confusing as heck (unless you are familiar with train system similar to Japan), if you look at the train system map, your eyes would be swirling around.--way too many colored lines, intersecting with one another. Their train lines are color-coded, so you won't be kinda confused on where you are going, I'd recommend to check what train lines does your place have, what station to go. There are some station that knows how to speak English, but alot of it spoke only Japanese, so ready your Japanese and ask train staff how to get to this line and what not (or use google translate or DeepL)

        <li>Hachiko Statue- I will always love you Hachiko (If you don't know this place, you've been living under the rock)</li>
        <li>Tower of Records- For music lovers and collectors of CD's and such, this is your (our) place, every genre that you can think of, City Pop to top artists to classicals to game OST to Anime to Vtuber stuff, their catalogue of music is immaculate.

      <h3 id="harajuku"><strong>Harajuku:</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The place of fashion...and expensive taste, i was stunned at how many fashion stores there are. For the expensive taste, well there's the famous luxury brands like Dior, Gucci, Louie Vuitton,  and other stuff. I felt the slap of poor-ness when entering the stores, mind you, Harajuku is not the "expensive" town yet, there's Ginza ( as I was told). I saw different types of fashion and phew, here I thought me and my brother were the stylish ones.
      </p>

      <h3 id="other"><strong>Other recommendations:</strong></h3>
      <p>These are some </p>

      <h4><strong>Shopping/Arcade:</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Book-Off & Hard-Off- This is a shop the sells second-hand of everything, i truly mean it. Clothes, Manga, Figurines, Electronics, Gadgets, like whatever you can think of, its there.</li>
        <li>Aeon Mall- I only added this is because of the Arcade section of it, i haven't been that famous SEGA building, and alot of the "Arcade" place that i see were pachinko slots (a slot machine). So when I say "Arcade", what i mean is  you see different type of machines, racing cars, rhythm games section</li>
      </ul>

      <h4><strong>Food:</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Gindako-</li>
