        I've traveled Japan for the first time and it did not disappoint me. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to go to Japan to see the whole culture: the festivals, the bustling streets of Tokyo (the famous crossing), its glorious catalogs of Anime, Manga, Collections...and Music (as a music lover and collector, there are some places that are truly worth looking), and boi oh boi, it was so glorious I couldn't contain my tears. 
        It was the best traveling experience I've ever had. This is my entry (or guide) of my experience in Japan.
         <strong>Do note, while the experience is so fun, let us not glorify Japan and other countries; like any other countries out there, Japan is no exception to problems. And also, when traveling to Japan (or in general), please be respectful — let's not be one of those tourists.
      </strong></p>

      <p>
        Most of these places were traveled by train and bus...and <strong>a lot</strong> of walking. Wear something that is comfortable and won't hurt your feet while walking and standing. Before I start, let's talk about the train system — it was confusing as heck (unless you are familiar with a train system similar to Japan). If you look at the train map, your eyes would be swirling around — way too many colored lines, intersecting with one another! 
        Their train lines are color-coded, so you won't be too confused on where you are going. I'd recommend checking what train lines your destination has and which station to go to. Some station staff speak English, but a lot only speak Japanese, so ready your Japanese and ask for help (or use Google Translate or DeepL).

      <h3><strong>Ueno:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ueno Park</strong> – Beautiful and peaceful, especially during cherry blossom season.</li>
        <li><strong>Ameyoko Shopping District</strong> – A lively market full of food stalls, clothes, and souvenirs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><strong>Asakusa:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Senso-Ji Temple</strong> – One of Tokyo’s oldest temples; vibrant, spiritual, and full of history.</li>
        <li><strong>Sumida Aquarium</strong> – Modern and colorful aquatic exhibits inside the Tokyo Skytree complex.</li>
        <li><strong>Inside Tokyo Skytree</strong> – Breathtaking panoramic view of the city; an absolute must-see.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><strong>Urayasu:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mitsui Outlet Park Makuhari</strong> – Great for shopping with good deals on branded items.</li>
        <li><strong>Disney Sea</strong> – An incredible theme park experience, beautifully detailed and immersive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><strong>Akihabara:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mandarake</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Animate</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Hobby-shop</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Akiba-Hobby</strong></li>
        <li><strong>K-books</strong></li>

      <p>
        Each of these shops offers something unique for anime, manga, and hobby enthusiasts. Akihabara is truly the otaku paradise.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Shibuya:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hachiko Statue</strong> – I will always love you, Hachiko. (If you don’t know this place, you’ve been living under a rock!)</li>
        <li><strong>Tower Records</strong> – For music lovers and collectors of CDs and vinyl, this is your haven. From City Pop to game OSTs to Vtuber albums, this place is full of rare gems.</li>
        <li><strong>Shibuya Crossing</strong> – The famous intersection filled with life and motion — you’ll want to take that classic video crossing too, ehe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><strong>Harajuku:</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The place of fashion... and expensive taste! I was stunned at how many fashion stores there were. Luxury brands like Dior, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton line the streets. I felt the slap of poor-ness entering those stores, mind you — Harajuku isn’t even the “expensive” town yet (there’s Ginza, as I was told). Still, it’s full of stylish people and creative outfits that made me rethink my own fashion sense.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Other Recommendations:</strong></h3>
      <p>These are some other great spots and experiences worth mentioning:</p>

      <h4><strong>Shopping / Arcade:</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Book-Off & Hard-Off</strong> – Second-hand heaven. Clothes, manga, figurines, electronics — you name it.</li>
        <li><strong>Aeon Mall</strong> – Notable for its arcade section with rhythm games, racing machines, and more.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4><strong>Food:</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gindako</strong></li> 
        <li><strong>Yoshinoya</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Gusto</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Jonathan's</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Coco's</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Peruvian Restaurant</strong> (forgot the name!)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For now, that’s my Japan experience — a mix of nostalgia, excitement, and pure admiration for a country full of life, art, and beauty.</p>
